# audio-visualizer
A collection (a very tiny one as of now) of three.js audio visualizer FXs

## FXs
Effects are rendered using the three.js library and uses the WebAudio API for listening to audio. Some input delay is to be expected as well as some lag on low-end devices. **App contains flashing, flickering, and other visual effects, so please beware if you are sensitive to this stuff.**

### Lines and sparkles
<sub>*Three.js and used shaders are based on the amazing work by [Louis Hoebregts](https://codepen.io/Mamboleoo/pen/yLbxYdx). Please go check out his work. WARNING some really cool stuff ahead.*</sub>

This visualizer has the following 3D-objects:
- guitar
- speaker
- human DNA
